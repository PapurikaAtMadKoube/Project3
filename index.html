            <p class="place__paragraph">Kyiv (or Kiev), Ukraine's capital, is a large city located on the shores of
              the Dnipro river. Of course, no one in their right mind would swim in the river, unless they grew up here,
              in which case they've probably tried it at some point. Summers are hot here, and the winters are drafty,
              but the fall and the spring are are absolutely amazing.</p>
            <p class="place__paragraph">The city itself is a mix of pre-revolution, post&#8209war and soviet
              architecture, all of it sprinkled with modified balconies. If you're on the right bank of the Dnipro,
              the landscape is difficult to traverse for people on bikes and those wearing heels. The left bank is
              considered far less interesting and prestigious though, even by people who live on the far outskirts of
              the right one.</p>

            <p class="place__paragraph">The medieval ruin of Cricieth Castle overlooks the town below from a rock that
              juts out into the sea. It
              is thought to have been built by Llewelyn the Great in the 13th century. Some 900 years later, the
              self&#8209styled Pearl of Wales on the Shores of Snowdonia has become a popular tourist destination during
              the
              summer months.</p>
            <p class="place__paragraph">A short walk down the road from the castle, you can enjoy the
              world's best ice
              cream at Cadwalader's,
              whose secret ingredient is rumored to be locally sourced seaweed. Another claim to fame is the fact that
              Cricieth won the Wales in Bloom award for five years in a row for its spectacular floral displays around
              town. It was also home to David Lloyd George, the only Welshman ever to hold the office of Prime Minister
              of the UK.</p>

          <div class="place__text mobile_narrow">
            <p class="place__paragraph">Berea is a small town located in the central part of Kentucky. The town is
              surrounded by beautiful forests and countryside. It's known as the arts and crafts capital of the state,
              and
              visitors will find plenty of shopping opportunities: shops with handmade jewelry, candles, wood items,
              galleries, glass studios, and more. The town holds a yearly festival celebrating "spoonbread", a local
              dish
              made with cornbread and served with a wooden spoon.</p>
            <p class="place__paragraph">However, it's probably known best for the local college. Berea College was
              founded
              in 1855 and was the first college in the south to be racially integrated, as well as the first to be
              coeducational. Somewhat uniquely, it charges no tuition — every student receives a full&#8209tuition
              scholarship. </p>

            <p class="place__paragraph">Muramvya is one of the 18 provinces of Burundi. In the kingdom era, Muramvya was
              the
              royal capital and in 2007, because of its cultural and natural landscape, it was added to the UNESCO World
              Heritage Tentative List. It is located in the center of Burundi, between the country's political and
              economic
              capitals</p>
            <p class="place__paragraph">The weather is rather chilly at night, but during the day, you would think
              you're
              in
              heaven. At 2,665 meters (8,743 ft) above sea level, Mount Teza is one of the coldest places in the
              province.
              But
              that cool breeze allows for one of the largest plantations of tea and coffee in the country, which make up
              the
              bulk of Burundi's exports.</p>
            <p class="place__paragraph">The Kibira National Park, one of the largest wildlife reserves for apes,
              overlaps
              four provinces, including Muramvya. This National Park lies at the apex of the beautiful mountains of the
              Congo-Nile Divide, ranging between 1550 and 2660 meters of altitude. It is filled with beautiful
              vegetation,
              and a source for the various rivers and streams which provide water around the country.</p>

              southern part of Zhejiang Province. The reserve occupies a mountainous, forested area. The highest peak is
              Baiyun Peak, which is 1,611 metres (5,285 ft) high. BirdLife International considers Wuyanling Reserve as
              an
              Important Bird Area (IBA). Birds of particular conservation value in the reserve include Cabot’s tragopan,
              much studied in the reserve, and Elliot’s pheasant.</p>
            <p class="place__paragraph">A freshwater goby, Rhinogobius wuyanlingensis, has been collected from
              Wuyanling,
              described as a new species to science, and named after the reserve.

              The reserve’s inhabitants also include the Chinese giant salamander. A specimen weighing 3.5 kg (7.7 lb),
              the largest one for a while, was observed in September 2012. This species, once common in the reserve, has
              greatly suffered from poaching.</p>
